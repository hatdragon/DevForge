# Texture & Atlas Browser

The Texture & Atlas Browser provides visibility into textures and visual assets available at runtime.

## Overview

WoW’s UI relies heavily on textures and atlases, many of which are undocumented or difficult to discover.

DevForge allows you to:
- Browse loaded textures
- Explore atlas categories
- Preview assets in-game
