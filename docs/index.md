# DevForge

**DevForge** is a developer toolkit addon for World of Warcraft.

It brings inspection, debugging, and exploration tools directly into the game client — designed for addon authors and technical users who want deeper visibility into WoW’s UI and API systems.

---

## What DevForge Does

DevForge provides tools to:

- Inspect live frames, objects, and tables
- Observe events and runtime behavior
- Execute Lua snippets safely
- Explore available APIs and assets
- Debug errors and performance issues

All from inside the game.

## Why DevForge Exists

As World of Warcraft’s addon environment continues to evolve — especially with increasing restrictions in Retail — developers need better visibility and safer tooling.

DevForge focuses on:
- Transparency over automation
- Capability-based features
- Compatibility across Retail and Classic clients

It also includes optional tooling to help bridge existing workflows as the addon ecosystem changes.

## Client Support

- **Retail:** Fully supported
- **Classic (current line):** Actively targeting parity
- **Classic Era:** Planned

Features automatically adapt based on client capabilities.

---

## Installation

Download the addon and extract it into your WoW AddOns folder:
World of Warcraft/<client>/Interface/AddOns/DevForge


Restart the game or reload the UI.

---

## Project Status

DevForge is under active development and approaching its initial public release.

Documentation, contribution guidelines, and additional tooling details will expand over time.
